# Model description

This model is an adaptation of the NetPyNE tutorial 8 net_lfp.py network, modified to make the populations, number of cells and locations, cell types, connectivity and inputs more similar to those of the HNN network (http://hnn.brown.edu). 

The model includes proximal and distal driving inputs, as well as an evoked input from 400ms to 600ms.

Result figures include: 
- raster plot
- spiking statistics
- LFP signal, power spectra, spectrogram, and electrode locations
- GUI population and connectivity specifications
- GUI instantiated network and results
